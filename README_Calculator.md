# Calculator Java Project: a + b = c

This is a simple Java project that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, specifically addition where a + b = c.

## Project Structure

- `Calculator.java` - Main class containing the calculator logic

## Features

- Simple addition function that takes two integers and returns their sum
- Main method with example calculations
- Multiple demonstration examples

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Calculator
   ```

## Expected Output

The program will output:
```
=== Simple Calculator: a + b = c ===
a = 5
b = 3
c = a + b = 5 + 3 = 8
Result: 5 + 3 = 8

=== More Examples ===
10 + 20 = 30
20 + 30 = 50
30 + 40 = 70
40 + 50 = 90
```

## Code Explanation

- The `add(int a, int b)` method performs the addition operation
- The `main` method demonstrates the concept with example values
- The program shows both a simple example (5 + 3 = 8) and additional examples using an array

This project demonstrates basic Java programming concepts including:
- Method definition and calling
- Variable declaration and assignment
- String concatenation
- Array usage
- Loop structures
